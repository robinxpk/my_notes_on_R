# my_notes_on_R
## What this is 
I want a place to document anything that seems relevant to me regarding R as I read through several books.
The goal is to have one up-to-date file in which every important prompt / function / etc. is noted for quick look-ups. Within the file I give sources to where I found what I noted. 
Every source has a folder (named accordingly) in which I will save some commented R examples and maybe more?
